One appealing thing about esculent is that this word, which comes from the Latin for food (esca), has been around for over 375 years. If we give you just one more tidbit of etymology-that esca is from Latin edere, which means "to eat"-can you pick which of the following words is NOT related to esculent? Comestible, edacious, edible, escalade, escarole, or obese. Comestible (meaning "edible"), edacious (meaning "voracious"), edible, escarole (a type of salad green), and obese are all descendants of edere. Only escalade (meaning "an act of scaling walls") doesn't belong on the list. It descends from the Italian scalare, meaning "to scale."

<p>What is food sharing? ... So sharing around food includes not just sharing food itself, but also the sharing of spaces and even skills around growing, preparing and eating food. Ultimately, for us, food sharing is doing things together around food.</p>
